## _Smart white cane for Visual Impaired_

#
#

We made Smart white cane with two Arduino R3, two Ultrasonic sensor, two DC motor, Photo Resistor, RGB LED strip, White cane

- Visual impaired can work outside in the dark
- It's a new way over traditional braille block walking.
- ✨ It's a tech that can replace expensive blind dogs.✨

## Features

- Sence forward 110° obstacle by dual ultrasonic sensor
- Inform Left, right, front one of three direction obstacle by dual DC motor  
- Auto light RGB LED strip after sunset
- Use 8 hours by DC 9V battery




> Seeing eye dogs have to educate at least 1~2 years
> and they cost at least $ 50,000 ~ $ 100,000 
> High costs are porblem, but far short of numbers for many Visual impaired.
> That's why we need to help a little more with our smart white cane.

## Tech


Smart white cane uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Arduino] - A little cost, but strong
- [devicemart] - Sell awesome many sensor and devices


And of course Smart white cane itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
